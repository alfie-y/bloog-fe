## Bloog Project

I built this site to practice learning React, with server-side rendering by Next.js. Pages are populated with content accessed through API calls to a dedicated back-end server.

### Key Features

- Different feeds to filter between topics and authors
- Highly responsive loading
- Clean, intuitive layout
- Dynamic styling to highlight interactable content
- Appropriately render and resize images
- Handles embedded content
- Random splash text!
